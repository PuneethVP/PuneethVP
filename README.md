# Hi there üëã ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:

I am **Puneeth Virushabadas**! I am currently a graduate student majoring in Computer and Information Science / Information Systems, focusing on data science, analytics, machine learning, and deep learning applications and tools.

- Currently working as a Data Analyst in the strategy and marketing department, developing Streamlit apps with automated ML jobs for customer segmentation and selection, creating performance dashboards, and implementing data science solutions at **Ouro Global Inc.** (formerly known as Netspend.com).
- I have three years of experience as a Software Engineer and Analyst working in Agile environments, developing and designing secure, scalable, and high-quality software solutions.
- My research interests include developing and tuning ML and Deep Learning models for forecasting, customer segmentation, business intelligence, and data analytics.
- Recently collaborated with **DataWorld** to analyze the accuracy and understanding of large language models (LLMs) through black-box testing on health FHIR databases using knowledge graphs. I implemented advanced prompting techniques to improve SPARQL query generation with the FHIR database.
- I am also exploring how **LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** models can drive business insights through more accurate data retrieval.
